# final

For my final project, I developed an interactive website that can potentially serves as my art/design portfolio. I am currently using Wix and other portfolio websites to store my works. The sites are usually really easy to navigate and will do the job, however I don’t always like their default layout or animation. I also don’t feel like paying extra to unlock additional features, so I figure maybe I can try to make my own website from scratch. I focus extensively on general interface and navigation, as well as incorporating small interactive features around the website to make it more personalized and engaging.
